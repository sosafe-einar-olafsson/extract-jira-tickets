# Extract Jira Tickets Script

This script, `extract-jira-tickets`, extracts Jira ticket numbers from the Git commit history between two Git tags. Itâ€™s useful for quickly identifying which Jira issues are associated with a particular range of commits.

## Usage

To use the script, you specify two Git tags as arguments to define the range of commits to search between. Optionally, you can use the `--issuekey` flag to wrap the output in a Jira query format.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
extract-jira-tickets <start-tag> <end-tag> [--issuekey]
```

### Examples

1. **Extract Jira Tickets between Two Tags**:

   ```bash
   extract-jira-tickets v1.0 v1.1
   ```

   This command will output Jira ticket numbers in a comma-separated list, like:

   ```
   FP-1049,FP-1051,FP-1142,...
   ```

2. **Wrap Output in a Jira Query Format**:

   Use the `--issuekey` flag if you want the output formatted as a Jira query, which is helpful for searching within Jira:

   ```bash
   extract-jira-tickets --issuekey v1.0 v1.1
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   issuekey in (FP-1049, FP-1051, FP-1142,...)
   ```
